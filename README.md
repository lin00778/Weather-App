# Weather-App

PUBH 7462 project

**About Weather App !!!**

There are three base datasets for this application, which include:

1.  City_Info: This dataset includes information about four famous spots for each city.

2.  CityGeo: This dataset includes geographical information for each city, which helps to link the dataset to the map in this app.

3.  weather_new: This dataset consists of two years of records of the weather conditions for 29 cities in the US.

**What's new !!!**

1.  We imported the weather condition data for totally 29 selected cities (New York, Los Angeles, etc.) from April 30th 2022 to April 30th 2023.

2.  We created our theme for the final version of the shiny app, including the set up of variables, the arrangement mode for our audience, and the list of our sidebar. 

3.  We switched the topic according to the professor's comments. We started to add plots and contents of our weather app. Using this app, the audience can easily obtain the weather condition the whole year in this city, the famous spot of this city, and the suggestion for travelers to the city. 

**What problems we have** **!!!**

1.  We still need to find dataset from more cities. Currently we only download the weather data for one city in the past one years. (We can only download the data from one city per day because the website we used will charge a fee for more data.)

2.  Since we change part of our product to recommend the user the famous spot in the city they chose, we need to collect the data about the interesting spots in each cities.

**What we need to do next !!!**

1.  We need to download more weather data for different cities (we need one more year of the data). We expected to include 29 cities which are selected by the ranking of the size of population in the US.

2.  Create a box providing the information about the travel suggestions based on the month selected in the side bar for the specific city (the city clicked on the map).
